# New questions

This is the staging area for new questions.
To add a question, create a folder with a descriptive name of your question (no spaces).
You are welcome to copy the `examplequestion` folder, which includes a minimum working example.

Using LaTeX, write the question and answer in a single file, similar to the format of `examplequestion`.
Your folder should contain all the files that the question depends on, like bibliographies or pictures.
If your question requires code, use the `minted` or `verbatim` environment.
Indicate whether your question appears in any of the classic interview question-and-answer texts mentioned in the primer.

Fork this repository, and create a pull request when you are done.
