\section{Question}

Consider an at the money call option, expiring in one month.
It has a strike price of $K$, and the current price of the underling is $S$, where $S \approx K$.
The value of this option, using Black-Scholes and assuming that the risk-free rate of return is small and no dividents are due, is
\begin{align*}
S N(d_1)
- K e^{-r(T-t)} N(d_2)
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
 d_1 =
 \frac{
      \log\left( \frac{S}{K} \right)
      + \left( r + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2  \right)(T - t)
 }{
 \sigma \sqrt{T - t}
 }
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
 d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T - t}
 \text{.}
\end{align*}
Given the special case where $S \approx K$ and one month to expiry, $(T-t) = 1/12$, how can we simplify this equation into something that can be quickly done on the back of an envelope by traders?


\section{Answer}

This question is asking you to prove that the price of a call option can be approximated by
\begin{align*}
  S \sigma \sqrt{\frac{T - t}{2\pi} }
\text{,}
\end{align*}
which is a well known result.%
\footnote{See Question 2.20 of \citet{HeardOnTheStreet} for more details.}
We don't require rigour, a heuristic proof will do.
Start with the price of a call option
\begin{align}
\label{eq:calloption:price}
S N(d_1)
- K e^{-r(T-t)} N(d_2)
\end{align}
and note that $e^{-r(T-t)} \approx 1$ when $r \approx 0$ and the time-to-expiry, $(T-t)$, is small.
Also substitute $K$ with $S$, leaving
\begin{align} \label{eq:approxfun:1}
S \times ( N(d_1) -  N(d_2) )
\text{.}
\end{align}
Next, consider $d_1$, and again use $K \approx S$ and $r \approx 0$, then
\begin{align*}
 d_1
 &=
 \frac{
      \log\left( \frac{S}{S} \right)
      + \left( 0 + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2  \right)(T - t)
 }{
 \sigma \sqrt{T - t}
 } \\
 &=
 \frac{
      \left(\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2  \right)(T - t)
 }{
 \sigma \sqrt{T - t}
 } \\
 &=
 \frac{1}{2} \sigma \sqrt{T - t}
\\
 &= d_1^*
\text{.}
\end{align*}
Then you have
\begin{align*}
 d_2^* &= d_1^* - \sigma \sqrt{T - t} \\
       &=  -  \frac{1}{2} \sigma \sqrt{T - t} \\
       &=  - d_1^*
\end{align*}
which reduces
\eqref{eq:approxfun:1} to
\begin{align} \label{eq:approxfun:2}
S \times ( N(d_1^*) -  N(-d_1^*) )
\text{.}
\end{align}
Consider the function $N(x)$; the cumulative density function of the standard normal distribution.
We can approximate it using the Taylor series.
Let $N'(x) = f(x)$ be the probability density function of the standard normal distribution, then
\begin{align*}
N(x - a) = N(a)
          + f(a)(x - a)
          + \frac{1}{2!}f'(a)(x - a)^2
          + \frac{1}{3!}f''(a)(x - a)^3
          + \ldots
\end{align*}
and consider the first order approximation:
\begin{align*}
N(x - a) = N(a)
          + f(a)(x - a)
\end{align*}
and since
\begin{align*}
f(x) =
     \frac{1}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi } }
     e^{ - \frac{1}{2} (x)^2 }
\end{align*}
you have
\begin{align*}
N(d_1^*)&= N(d_1^* - 0) \\
            &= N(0) + f(0)(d_1^* - 0) \\
            &= \frac{1}{2} +  \frac{1}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi } }
            (d_1^* )
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
N(-d_1^*) &= \frac{1}{2} +  \frac{1}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi } } (- d_1^* )
\text{.}
\end{align*}
Putting this into \eqref{eq:approxfun:2} yields
\begin{align*}
&\phantom{{}={}}
S \times \left(
\frac{1}{2} +  \frac{1}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi } } ( d_1^* ) -
\left(
\frac{1}{2} +  \frac{1}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi } } (- d_1^* )
\right)
\right)
\\
&=
S \times \left(
    \frac{2}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi } } ( d_1^* )
\right)
\\
&=
S \times \left(
    \frac{ 2 }{ \sqrt{ 2 \pi } }
    \left(
    \frac{1}{2} \sigma \sqrt{T - t}
    \right)
\right)
\\
&=
S \times \left(
     \sigma
    \sqrt{\frac{ T - t }{  2 \pi  }}
\right)
\text{,}
\end{align*}
giving us the required result.
Traders can use this to quickly approximate the price of a call option.
The accuracy of this approximation is shown in the figure below, drawn using
the values
$K = 80$,
$r = 0$,
$(T-t) = 30/365$, and
$\sigma=0.2$.
My interviewer wanted me to draw something like this by hand, and then we discussed the appropriateness of the approximation.

The approximation is only accurate when the difference between the stock price and the strike price is small, and accuracy rapidly deteriorates as this difference grows.
The approximation, however, is so useful that traders know it by heart and are expected to calculate it in their heads (using $1/\sqrt{2\pi} \approx 0.4$).
This approximation is derived with more rigour in Question 2.20 of \citet{HeardOnTheStreet}, by assuming that the stock price follows arithmetic Brownian motion instead of geometric Brownian motion.
\citet{HeardOnTheStreet} then uses the result to answer questions 2.21, 2.22, and 2.23.
My interviewer also asked me what causes the shape of the call option and why it is above the dashed line.
I explained that the call option should be above the dashed line, since it's value lay in the uncertainty: if there is still time left until maturity, and if the variance is large enough, the call option will have a positive value.
He said that he was looking for a more basic interpretation, and provided the hint that a the call option price is an expected value:
\begin{equation*}
\text{option value} = e^{-r(T-t)} \operatorname{E}\left( \text{Payoff}(S) \right)
\text{.}
\end{equation*}
From this I was able to gather that he wanted me to talk about Jensen's inequality.
In the context of probability theory, Jensen's inequality is generally stated in the following form: if $X$ is a random variable and $f$ is a convex function, then
\begin{equation*}
\operatorname{E}\left[ f(X) \right] \geq
f\left(\operatorname{E}\left[ X \right] \right)
\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In the case of a call option price you have
\begin{equation*}
 \operatorname{E}\left[ \text{Payoff}(S) \right] \geq
 \text{Payoff}\left(\operatorname{E}\left[ S \right]\right)
 \text{,}
\end{equation*}
since the payoff is a convex function.
\citet[chap.~2]{WilmottFAQ}
and
\citet[sec.~4.3]{wilmott2013intro}
explain option prices and Jensen's inequality in more detail.
Also see question 2.18 of
\cite{HeardOnTheStreet}
for the nuances of drawing figures like Figure \ref{fig:calloptionapprox}.


As is clear from this text, I didn't get many questions about Black and Scholes, stochastic calculus, and derivative pricing.
This is probably because I applied for roles leaning more towards statistics instead of pricing, but at the time of writing I also found more statistics jobs advertised than pricing ones.
While there is still work for pricing quants, there has been a strong focus on modelling roles in recent years.%
\footnote{The demand has been helped along by the hype generated by rebranding statistics as machine learning and data science.}
There has also been more roles focused on software development, under the label of strategists or \emph{strats}.
Your mileage may vary, I suggest interviewing for some roles and then to adjust your preparatory material according to what you encounter.
The classic interview texts,
\cite{HeardOnTheStreet},
\cite{WilmottFAQ}, and
\citet{JoshiQA}
feature plenty of questions about derivative pricing.
