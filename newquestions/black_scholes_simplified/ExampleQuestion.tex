\section{Question}

Consider an at the money call option, expiring in one month.
It has a strike price of $K$, and the current price of the underling is $S$, where $S \approx K$.
The value of this option, using Black-Scholes and assuming that the risk-free rate of return is small and no dividents are due, is
\begin{align*}
S N(d_1)
- K e^{-r(T-t)} N(d_2)
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
 d_1 =
 \frac{
      \log\left( \frac{S}{K} \right)
      + \left( r + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2  \right)(T - t)
 }{
 \sigma \sqrt{T - t}
 }
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
 d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T - t}
 \text{.}
\end{align*}
Given the special case where $S \approx K$ and one month to expiry, $(T-t) = 1/12$, how can we simplify this equation into something that can be quickly done on the back of an envelope by traders?


\section{Answer}

This question is asking you to prove that the price of a call option can be approximated by
\begin{align*}
  S \sigma \sqrt{\frac{T - t}{2\pi} }
\text{,}
\end{align*}
which is a well known result.%
\footnote{See Question 2.20 of \citet{HeardOnTheStreet} for more details.}
We don't require rigour, a heuristic proof will do.
Start with the price of a call option
\begin{align}
\label{eq:calloption:price}
S N(d_1)
- K e^{-r(T-t)} N(d_2)
\end{align}
and note that $e^{-r(T-t)} \approx 1$ when $r \approx 0$ and the time-to-expiry, $(T-t)$, is small.
Also substitute $K$ with $S$, leaving
\begin{align} \label{eq:approxfun:1}
S \times ( N(d_1) -  N(d_2) )
\text{.}
\end{align}
Next, consider $d_1$, and again use $K \approx S$ and $r \approx 0$, then
\begin{align*}
 d_1
 &=
 \frac{
      \log\left( \frac{S}{S} \right)
      + \left( 0 + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2  \right)(T - t)
 }{
 \sigma \sqrt{T - t}
 } \\
 &=
 \frac{
      \left(\frac{1}{2}\sigma^2  \right)(T - t)
 }{
 \sigma \sqrt{T - t}
 } \\
 &=
 \frac{1}{2} \sigma \sqrt{T - t}
\\
 &= d_1^*
\text{.}
\end{align*}
Then you have
\begin{align*}
 d_2^* &= d_1^* - \sigma \sqrt{T - t} \\
       &=  -  \frac{1}{2} \sigma \sqrt{T - t} \\
       &=  - d_1^*
\end{align*}
which reduces
\eqref{eq:approxfun:1} to
\begin{align} \label{eq:approxfun:2}
S \times ( N(d_1^*) -  N(-d_1^*) )
\text{.}
\end{align}
Consider the function $N(x)$; the cumulative density function of the standard normal distribution.
We can approximate it using the Taylor series.
Let $N'(x) = f(x)$ be the probability density function of the standard normal distribution, then
\begin{align*}
N(x - a) = N(a)
          + f(a)(x - a)
          + \frac{1}{2!}f'(a)(x - a)^2
          + \frac{1}{3!}f''(a)(x - a)^3
          + \ldots
\end{align*}
and consider the first order approximation:
\begin{align*}
N(x - a) = N(a)
          + f(a)(x - a)
\end{align*}
and since
\begin{align*}
f(x) =
     \frac{1}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi } }
     e^{ - \frac{1}{2} (x)^2 }
\end{align*}
you have
\begin{align*}
N(d_1^*)&= N(d_1^* - 0) \\
            &= N(0) + f(0)(d_1^* - 0) \\
            &= \frac{1}{2} +  \frac{1}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi } }
            (d_1^* )
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
N(-d_1^*) &= \frac{1}{2} +  \frac{1}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi } } (- d_1^* )
\text{.}
\end{align*}
Putting this into \eqref{eq:approxfun:2} yields
\begin{align*}
&\phantom{{}={}}
S \times \left(
\frac{1}{2} +  \frac{1}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi } } ( d_1^* ) -
\left(
\frac{1}{2} +  \frac{1}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi } } (- d_1^* )
\right)
\right)
\\
&=
S \times \left(
    \frac{2}{ \sqrt{ 2\pi } } ( d_1^* )
\right)
\\
&=
S \times \left(
    \frac{ 2 }{ \sqrt{ 2 \pi } }
    \left(
    \frac{1}{2} \sigma \sqrt{T - t}
    \right)
\right)
\\
&=
S \times \left(
     \sigma
    \sqrt{\frac{ T - t }{  2 \pi  }}
\right)
\text{,}
\end{align*}
giving us the required result.
Traders can use this to quickly approximate the price of a call option.
The accuracy of this approximation is shown in the figure below, drawn using
the values
$K = 80$,
$r = 0$,
$(T-t) = 30/365$, and
$\sigma=0.2$.

The approximation is only accurate when the difference between the stock price and the strike price is small, and accuracy rapidly deteriorates as this difference grows.
The approximation, however, is so useful that traders know it by heart and are expected to calculate it in their heads (using $1/\sqrt{2\pi} \approx 0.4$).
This approximation is derived with more rigour in Question 2.20 of \citet{HeardOnTheStreet}, by assuming that the stock price follows arithmetic Brownian motion instead of geometric Brownian motion.
\citet{HeardOnTheStreet} then uses the result to answer questions 2.21, 2.22, and 2.23.

In all my interviews, I didn't get many questions about Black and Scholes, stochastic calculus, and derivative pricing.
This is probably because I applied for roles leaning more towards statistics instead of pricing, but I also found more statistics jobs than pricing ones advertised at the time of writing.
While there is still work for pricing quants, there has been a stronger focus on modelling roles, helped along by the hype generated in rebranding statistics as machine learning.
There has also been more roles focused on software development, under the label of strategists or \emph{strats}.
Your mileage may vary, I suggest interviewing for some roles, and then to adjust your preparatory material according to what you are tested against.
The classic interview texts,
\cite{HeardOnTheStreet},
\cite{WilmottFAQ}, and
\citet{JoshiQA}
feature plenty of material for derivative pricing roles.
