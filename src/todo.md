# Things to do

 - [x] Stick Breaking
   Make sure all instances are the same. Should always be:
   \emph{Stick Breaking} problem
 - [x] Romeo and Juliet (should be emphasized, like the above)
   Make sure all instances are the same. Use script 4.
   Should always be:
   \emph{Romeo and Juliet} (nothing else in emphasis)
 - [x] A sentence should never start with "Which".
 - [x] Check the use of `` and ''. There were some errors earlier.
 - [ ] Check whether you overuse "this".
 - [x] Central limit theorem --> Central Limit Theorem
 - [x] Air force one --> Air Force One
 - [x] roll vs role
 - [x] minimise vs minimize. Prefer the former
 - [ ] Like the above, but more general check page 148 (dp 155) of economist style guide. Use script 5 to find possible errors.
 - [x] Practice vs practise. The former is a noun, the latter is a verb. Econ Style guide page 147. Use script 6.

 - [x] Check em-dashes, and follow Knuth math writing course. There shouldn't be any spaces like---this, not like --- this. (script 2)
 - [x] a vs an (script 1)


 - [x] Check all semicolons and see whether they can be done better. (Check page 105 in Knuth's math writing course)
