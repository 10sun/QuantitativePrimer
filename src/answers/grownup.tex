This is an opportunity to align your skills and experience to the team's needs.
Make sure your answers are in line with your area of expertise---even if you don't consider them wholly relevant.
Display your specialist knowledge and experience, and how you use both to solve unfamiliar problems.
Your job as a quant will involve solving problems using mathematics,
and so you need to be able to do so often and quickly.

Do not fall victim to hype.
For instance, don't use neural nets just because they are in fashion.
Stick with what you know.
If you want to show that you are well-read on the state of \emph{analytics} hype, mention how your answer is different from neural nets---or whatever is in fashion---and outline the benefits and caveats of both approaches.
If you are asked to discuss a particular topic you don't know much about, be honest about your limitations.
Often the interviewer isn't trying to catch you out, they are merely curious about the extent of your knowledge and your willingness to learn.
