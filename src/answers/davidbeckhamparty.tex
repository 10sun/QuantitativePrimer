The best way to solve this is to draw an adjacency matrix.
That is, a matrix filled with zeros and ones, where
row $i$ contains a one in column $j$ if person $i$ knows person $j$.
We let $\text{knows}(i,i)=0$, so the matrix has zeros on its diagonal.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
% Draw the numbers outside the matrix
\foreach \i in {1,...,3}
{
\draw (0.3,-\i) node{\i};
\draw (\i,-0.3) node{\i};
}
% Draw the matrix
\foreach \x in {1,...,3}
\foreach \y in {1,...,3}
{
\draw (\x,-\y) +(-.5,-.5) rectangle ++(.5,.5);
\draw (\x,-\y) node (n\y\x) {knows(\y,\x)}; %reverse the x and y to give the expected behaviour
}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Think about what this matrix would look like given the conditions of the party in the question.
I draw a $9 \times 9$ matrix here, but you can quickly draw a smaller one to get the just of it.
The important thing to realise is that David Beckhamâ€™s row will be empty, and his columns would be filled with ones (except for the diagonal element).
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6]
% Draw the numbers outside the matrix
\foreach \i in {1,...,9}
{
\draw (0,-\i) node{\i};
\draw (\i,0) node{\i};
}
% Draw the matrix
\foreach \x in {1,...,9}
{
  % Make nodes on the outside of the matrix on the right side
  % Label them with o1, o2, etc.
  \draw (10,-\x) node (o\x) {};
  \foreach \y in {1,...,9}
  {
    \draw (\x,-\y) +(-.5,-.5) rectangle ++(.5,.5);
    % Make the node a circle for space reasons, but don't draw it
    \draw (\x,-\y) node[circle, inner sep=2mm] (n\y\x) {}; %reverse the x and y to give the expected behaviour
  }
}
% Draw some ones
% David Beckham is person 6
% %Everyong knows someone, except Beckham
\draw (n14) node{1};
\draw (n21) node{1};
\draw (n32) node{1} (n37) node{1};
\draw (n42) node{1};
\draw (n52) node{1} (n58) node{1};
% Beckham's row
\draw (n78) node{1} (n75) node{1};
\draw (n83) node{1} (n89) node{1};

%Everyone knows David Beckham
\draw (n16) node{1};
\draw (n26) node{1};
\draw (n36) node{1};
\draw (n46) node{1};
\draw (n56) node{1};
\draw (n76) node{1};
\draw (n86) node{1};
\draw (n96) node{1};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
We can use the function to fill in values until we find David Beckham.
But filling the whole matrix is expensive. For $n$ people, we would need $n^2$ evaluations of the function.
We need to find a smarter way to find Beckham's row.

Start with person 1 and located the first non-zero entry for their row.
We have now learned two things:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Person 1 is not David Beckham (since David Beckham doesn't know anyone at the party).
  \item None of the people who person 1 doesn't know can be David Beckham. (Everyone at the party knows David Beckham, so if person 1 doesn't know you, you \emph{can't} be David Beckham.)
\end{enumerate}
The second point is nuanced and it is the crux.
If you don't identify it yourself, talk through the problem and hopefully the interviewer will nudge you in the right direction.
We will use this knowledge to rapidly discount whole blocks of people as ``not Beckham''.
Start at person 1 and check their row.
When we find a 1, we jump to that person (who might be David Beckham).
For all the zeros we find, we can discount those people as not being David Beckham, and as soon as we find a one, we know the current person also isn't David Beckham.
If we get to the end of any row, that person is David Beckham.
This method only requires $n$ evaluations of the function since we just need to traverse all the columns, as indicated by the following picture.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6]
% Draw the numbers outside the matrix
\foreach \i in {1,...,9}
{
\draw (0,-\i) node{\i};
\draw (\i,0) node{\i};
}
% Draw the matrix
\foreach \x in {1,...,9}
{
  % Make nodes on the outside of the matrix on the right side
  % Label them with o1, o2, etc.
  \draw (10,-\x) node (o\x) {};
  \foreach \y in {1,...,9}
  {
    \draw (\x,-\y) +(-.5,-.5) rectangle ++(.5,.5);
    % Make the node a circle for space reasons, but don't draw it
    \draw (\x,-\y) node[circle, inner sep=1mm] (n\y\x) {}; %reverse the x and y to give the expected behaviour
  }
}
% Draw some ones
% David Beckham is person 6
% %Everyong knows someone, except Beckham
\draw (n14) node{1};
\draw (n21) node{1};
\draw (n32) node{1} (n37) node{1};
\draw (n42) node{1};
\draw (n52) node{1} (n58) node{1};
% Beckham's row
\draw (n78) node{1} (n75) node{1};
\draw (n83) node{1} (n89) node{1};

%Everyone knows David Beckham
\draw (n16) node{1};
\draw (n26) node{1};

\draw[->] (n66) to (o6) node[anchor=west]{Beckham};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

If Victoria Beckham is also at a party with nine people, the matrix might look like the following example, where David and Victoria are individuals 4 and 6.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6]
% Draw the numbers outside the matrix
\foreach \i in {1,...,9}
{
\draw (0,-\i) node{\i};
\draw (\i,0) node{\i};
}
% Draw the matrix
\foreach \x in {1,...,9}
{
  % Make nodes on the outside of the matrix on the right side
  % Label them with o1, o2, etc.
  \draw (10,-\x) node (o\x) {};
  \foreach \y in {1,...,9}
  {
    \draw (\x,-\y) +(-.5,-.5) rectangle ++(.5,.5);
    % Make the node a circle for space reasons, but don't draw it
    \draw (\x,-\y) node[circle, inner sep=2mm] (n\y\x) {}; %reverse the x and y to give the expected behaviour
  }
}
% Draw some ones
% David Beckham is person 6
% %Everyong knows someone, except Beckham
\draw (n13) node{1};
\draw (n21) node{1};
\draw (n32) node{1} (n37) node{1};
 %Victoria's row
\draw (n52) node{1} (n58) node{1};
 % Beckham's row
\draw (n78) node{1} (n75) node{1};
\draw (n83) node{1} (n89) node{1};


%Everyone knows David Beckham and Victoria
\draw (n14) node{1} (n16) node{1};
\draw (n24) node{1} (n26) node{1};
\draw (n34) node{1} (n36) node{1};
\draw               (n46) node{1};
\draw (n54) node{1} (n56) node{1};
\draw (n64) node{1}              ;
\draw (n74) node{1} (n76) node{1};
\draw (n84) node{1} (n86) node{1};
\draw (n94) node{1} (n96) node{1};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The same logic as before applies.
We start at the first person, and ask whether they know person $2, 3, 4, \ldots, n$.
Each individual they don't know can be discounted as \emph{not} Victoria \emph{nor} David.
The last two people we visit using this method are David and Victoria Beckham.
(We cannot identify which is which, but we weren't asked to.)
Below, the final picture shows how we will traverse the matrix.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6]

\foreach \i in {1,...,9}
{
\draw (0,-\i) node{\i};
\draw (\i,0) node{\i};

\foreach \x in {1,...,9}
{
  % Make nodes on the outside of the matrix on the right side
  % Label them with o1, o2, etc.
  \draw (10,-\x) node (o\x) {};
  \foreach \y in {1,...,9}
  {
    \draw (\x,-\y) +(-.5,-.5) rectangle ++(.5,.5);
    % Make the node a circle for space reasons, but don't draw it
    \draw (\x,-\y) node[circle, inner sep=1mm] (n\y\x) {}; %reverse the x and y to give the expected behaviour

The topic tested here comes from graph or network theory.
\index{Graph theory}
It has more to do with computer algorithms than mathematics.
While these kinds of questions aren't that prevalent, they are becoming more common with some hedge funds and high-frequency trading firms who place high emphasis on algorithms and programming skills.
If you are required to do a pre-interview coding test, chances are you will see a graph theory problem.
They used to be popular in Google interviews back when they still asked brainteasers.
Google have since stopped doing it after discovering that brainteaser performance was a bad predictor of actual job performance.\footnote{See, for instance, this newspaper article by \citet{GoogleBrainteasers}.}
It would be prudent of readers not to assume finance houses will come to the same conclusion any time soon.
